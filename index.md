[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/convco)](https://crates.io/crates/convco)

A Conventional commit cli build with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

`convco` gives tools to work with [Conventional Commits][1].

The tool is still in early development, but already useful.
It provides already the following commands:

- [`convco changelog`](changelog): Create a changelog file.
- [`convco check`](check): Checks if a range of commits is following the convention.
- [`convco commit`](commit): Helps to make conventional commits.
- [`convco version`](version): Finds out the current or next version.
